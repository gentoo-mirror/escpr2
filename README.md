Gentoo escpr2 overlay
=====================

This repository
---------------

The name of this repository is **Epson Inkjet Printer Driver 2 (ESC/P-R)** repository, in short **escpr2**.

For the owners of certain Epson printers the open source **Printer Driver 2 (ESC/P-R) for Linux** or **`escpr2`** will enable printing with LPR/CUPS (Common Unix Printing System). While the [`net-print/epson-inkjet-printer-escpr`](https://packages.gentoo.org/packages/net-print/epson-inkjet-printer-escpr) package is in the official Gentoo [portage](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Portage) tree, `net-print/epson-inkjet-printer-escpr2` is not.

A complete list of supported printers is in the `./ppd` directory of the source file, among them are e.g. certain Epson WorkForce and EcoTank series printers.

The ebuild will download the files directly from the *Seiko Epson Corporation*. Because Epson removes old versions upon release of a new one, **older ebuilds will not work** unless you already obtained the required files and have them available in your [distfiles](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/DISTDIR) directory.

Please note that Epson releases the driver unter the LGPL-2.1 and an EULA, which is a **limited license** for **personal and internal business use!**

Brief history
-------------

The full history can be read in [Gentoo Bug #662364](https://bugs.gentoo.org/662364). In short: Because an ebuild for `net-print/epson-inkjet-printer-escpr2` was missing, an existing ebuild already written by Mike Gilbert (floppym) was used and updated.

How to add the repository
-------------------------

### eselect-repository

This is the prefered method.

    eselect repository enable escpr2

Running `emerge --sync escpr2` will sync only this repository. To remove it, simply use `disable` in the above command.

### repos.conf

This is the manual method. Just copy `escpr2.conf` to `/etc/portage/repos/` and modify it for your configuration, e.g. using nano:

    wget https://gitlab.com/at.gentoo.repo/epson-inkjet-printer-escpr2/-/raw/master/escpr2.conf -O /etc/portage/repos.conf/escpr2.conf
    nano /etc/portage/repos.conf/escpr2.conf

Especially the `location` field must be set correctly, but disabling `auto-sync` could also be an interesting option for those who don't want to get regular updates.

How to add the license
----------------------

The `EPSON-EULA` must be an accepted license. After reading it, you may add it to your `make.conf`. Please consult the [Gentoo Wiki on make.conf](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki//etc/portage/make.conf#ACCEPT_LICENSE) on how to do that.

How to install the printer driver
---------------------------------

There are two packages available: the source tarball and the binary package. Both originate from Epson directly.

### net-print/epson-inkjet-printer-escpr2

This is the preferred ebuild. It downloads the publicly available sources from Epson.

    emerge -a net-print/epson-inkjet-printer-escpr2

### net-print/epson-inkjet-printer-escpr2-bin

The binary package and the source ebuild cannot be installed at the same time. Also, the binary ebuild requires `ACCEPT_KEYWORDS=~amd64` or `ACCEPT_KEYWORDS=~x86`. Use it only if you have problems with the source package.

    emerge -a net-print/epson-inkjet-printer-escpr2-bin

Bugs
----

Only bugs (and enhancements or suggestions) concerning the ebuilds should be reported to [Gentoo Bug #662364](https://bugs.gentoo.org/662364). Problems with the driver must be reported upstream. From ./AUTHORS in the source tarball: Seiko Epson Corporation <linux-printer@epson.jp>.
